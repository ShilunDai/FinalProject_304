# Abstract
The 2020 America President Election was held on November 3, 2020, which is a milestone for the United States. As it has ended for more than a month now, the news that rich people prefer to vote for Joe Biden evokes the hypothesis that income has a tremendous impact on the voting preference. This report utilized propensity score matching process, along with logistic model to investigate the impact of income on voting preference based on the survey data of 6479 Americans about their personal information, including age, education, income and etc. The report successfully concluded that income is a key element in the 2020 American President Election.

# Introduction
The questions that motivate most studies in the health, social and statistical sciences are not associational but causal in nature(Pearl, 2009). Casual inference method is ubiquitous to observational experiment. It's is often more feasible and reliable than other methods. Thus, having ability to make casual inference is key from both an economic and behavioral perspective.

One popular way to make causal inference is through propensity score matching. Propensity score analysis is a statistical technique developed for estimating treatment effects with nonexperimental or observational data(Guo & Fraser). It was initially introduced in 1983 and became popular recent years(Abadie, A., & Imbens, G., 2016). 

As the exciting 2020 America President Election has come to an end for more than one month now, Joe Biden was elected to take charge of the government for the next four years. The competition is fierce, and the result is shown in Table 1 below:

Supporters of different parties may have different features, especially income. Understanding the structure of voters of each party is a key point for candidates to win the election. To study this problem, this report will review the 2020 American President Election results using Nationscape data and use propensity score matching technique to conclude if there is a causal link between whether or not voters have high income and whether or not they are willing to voting for Joe Biden. The report successfully generates that income is a key element in 2020 American President Election.

Two data sets will be used to investigate how propensity score could be used to make inferences on the causal link between income and voting preference. In the Methodology section(Section 2), the way to simulate the data along with the logistic model that was used to perform the propensity score analysis was described. In the Results section(Section 3), it showed the results of the propensity score analysis. Finally, the inferences of this data along with conclusions were presented in the Conclusion section(Section 4).


# Methodology
## Data
We obtained the data set 'Nationscape' on the Voter Study Group website. Nationscape is one of the largest public opinion survey projects(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck., 2020). It interviews people in nearly every county, congressional district, and city in the leadup to the 2020 election(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck., 2020). 'Nationscape is fielded by Lucid, a market research platform that provides access to authentic, targeted audiences' (Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck., 2020).

In this study, the target population for this data is all persons who are eligible to vote, i.e., America citizens over the age of 18 or order(The America Voting Population, n.d.). The target frame is the respondents that is 'constructed to be representative of population in terms of a specified set of characteristics' using purposive sampling(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). The target frame is provided by Lucid, a market research platform that runs an online exchange for survey respondents(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). The sample data frame is drawn from this exchange to match a set of demographic quotas on age, gender, ethnicity, region, income, and education, which will be sent from Lucid directly to survey software operated by the Nationscape team(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). All respondents take the survey online and must complete an attention check before taking the survey and the language used in the survey is English(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). 

The data is observational data, meaning the data were collected based on random selection upon observations rather than a fully experimental data collection and introducing a systematic intervention to study any effects. The sampling method for this data set is weighting the survey data to represent the American population(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). The total observation of this data is 4296 and the estimated population size for this survey is 6479(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020).

The survey uses appropriate weighted sampling strategy since the observations that are collected will represent the target population accurately(Tausanovitch, Chris and Lynn Vavreck, 2020). The multi-diversity and detailed information of each observation involved in this data make it a good source for propensity score matching. Another advantage of the survey is that the size of data set is large, with a large number of observations and diverse variables. Large sample size will provide more accurate estimators to estimate the population. However, the data we use were collected on 25th June, 2020 which was not the latest information. Thus, the model we built will only be accurate when it's applied to estimate the effect of income before June 2020. 

The Nationscape data set has quite a lot of predictors, a few of which are considered important to this analysis are: state of residence, gender, age, race, education background, income and voting choice. We selected the variable $vote\_2020$ and eight other variables from the data set to do the analysis. 

$vote\_2020$ is a categorical variable representing the candidate a respondent wants to vote for. We only leave the observations voting for candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden since other candidates only have minor supporters. $voting\_intention$ is a categorical variable demonstrating whether or not a respondent would like to vote in the election. We filter the observations who respond 'Yes, I will vote' and 'Not sure' in this part, ignoring those who respond 'No, I am not eligible to vote' and "No, I will not vote but I am eligible". $registration$ is a categorical variable that shows whether or not voters will register to vote in 2020. Obviously, we only choose those who registered. $age$ is a numerical variable, measured in years. $gender$ is a categorical variable. It was treated as a dummy variable in the logistic regression model. $education$ is a categorical variable and respondents will choose their education background. $state$ is a categorical variable representing the geometric location that a respondent living in right now. $household\_income$ is a categorical variable. It shows the number of dollars the respondent earned per year. The last variable is $race\_ethnicity$ representing observations' race. Besides, we construct a new variable $income\_high$. It is a categorical dummy variable representing whether or not the income of respondents is greater than $\$150,000$ in one year. The variable $income\_high$ equals to 1 (Yes) if they earn more than $\$150,000$ and equals to 0 (No) otherwise.

Those variables were selected because they are representative which have minor duplication between each respondent. And they contain more valid responses and are likely to have relationships with voting preference and income. In this section, We first filter the individuals over the age of 18 that are eligible to vote. Those who are registered and would have intention to vote in 2020 will be eventually obtained in our data set. Moreover, since most observations will vote for Donald Trump and Joe Biden, so we ignore voters who obtain other choices. What's more, we classify the income of these people into high income and low income. Those who earn more than $\$150,000$ in a year are labeled as having high income. Finally we removed $NAs$ in the data set. The total variables in our data frame is 10. 
      
Here is a glimpse of the data set:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Read in the raw data 
raw_data_survey <- read_dta("/Users/shaelyndai/Desktop/ns20200625.dta")
# Add the labels
raw_data_survey <- labelled::to_factor(raw_data_survey)
# Just keep some variables
reduced_data_survey <- 
  raw_data_survey %>% 
  dplyr::select(vote_2020,
         vote_intention,
         registration,
         age,
         gender,
         education,

#Adjust Data types
reduced_data_survey$age <- as.numeric(reduced_data_survey$age)
# Filter on survey data
#filter only on the people that are both registered & intented to vote (Optional, depends on your assumptions)
#(Assuming people will vote unless they explicitly say no)
filtered_data_survey <- reduced_data_survey %>% 
  dplyr::filter(registration=="Registered"&
           vote_intention!="No, I am not eligible to vote"&
           vote_intention!="No, I will not vote but I am eligible"&
           (vote_2020=="Donald Trump"|vote_2020=="Joe Biden")
  )

highincome <- c('$150,000 to $174,999','$175,000 to $199,999','$200,000 to $249,999','250,000 and above')
filtered_data_survey$income_high<-ifelse(filtered_data_survey$household_income %in%  highincome, 1, 0)
filtered_data_survey$income_high<-as.factor(filtered_data_survey$income_high)

filtered_data_survey<-na.omit(filtered_data_survey)

rm(raw_data_survey,reduced_data_survey)

table <- head(filtered_data_survey)
table1 <- table[0:5]
table2 <- table[6:10]
kable(table1, caption = 'The Information of the Part of Respondents in data frame')
kable(table2)
```

Besides, the data also presents some other interesting aspects. For example, the distribution of age. Based on 2020 Nationscape data, Figure 2 demonstrates that the mean age is approximately 48 years old. Most people in this data are order than 48 years old for the reason that the distribution of boxplot for age is right-skewed. Figure 3 demonstrates the barplot of gender and whether or not the respondent earns more than $\$150,000$ in one year. We notice that there are more males than females in this data frame and most of them does not have high income. However, the difference in number of males and females is not large, which means that the number of gender is balanced. It shows the distribution of respondents' income per year in Figure 4. Most voters earn less than $\$14,999$ for one year, those who earn $\$95,000$ to $\$99,999$ is chasing right behind. There are the least people who earn between $\$85,000$ to $\$89,999$ per year. Figure 5 states the education background of respondents. Most people graduated from college school, followed by those who completed some degree but get no degree. The number of people who graduate from 3rd grades or less is the least. From what we have seen in Figure 6 which demonstrates the distribution of race, white people lead in the distribution of race-ethnicity, and Black, or  African American follow behind. Only very few portions of voters are other races.

Generally, from Figure 2 to Figure 6, we conclude that most people in the data frame are white males who are 48 years old  or older with low income, obtaining college degree.

## Model

In order to look into the potential impact of income on the result of 2020 American President Election, this report utilized Rstudio software to implement propensity score matching technique with logistic model to calculate and estimate the voting preference of different income.

The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics(Austin, 2011). The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational study(Austin, 2011).

In this section, we first build a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of whether or not a voter has high income, which is propensity score. Then we match the voters with closest propensity score, with one is treated with high income and another is not. Finally, we reduced the data set with matched pairs to generate the impact of income on voting preference.

The logistic model will be focused on five large aspects of voters: age, gender, education background, state and race. Age will be a comparable larger aspect compared to other aspects, due to younger voters will tend to earn less money, while elder voters will tend to earn more. Sex could also be an interesting aspect, that voters of different sexes might have different income. Generally speaking, males earn more than females. The educational level is considered a high-weighted aspect. Although the income is not necessarily based on higher education backgrounds, the potential benefit from higher educations could still benefit to get a great job. States may influence the voters' income level based on consumption level and culture. Finally, race is considered another important aspect. White males are considered to earn more salaries. Logistic model has the advantage of estimating binary outcomes, which is either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). Transforming income into whether or not they have high income can greatly take advantage of logistic model to calculate the propensity score. 

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
#Propensity Score
propensity_score <- glm(income_high ~ age + gender + education + state + race_ethnicity, 
                        family = binomial,
                        data = filtered_data_survey)
```

Using the data selected, we build a logistic regression model to calculate the propensity score with the following formula:

$$
log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}) = \beta_{0} +\beta_{1}  x_{age,j}+\beta_{2}  x_{gender,j}+ \beta_{3}  x_{education,j}  + \beta_{4} x_{state,j}+\beta_{5}  x_{race\_ethnicity,j}
$$

$log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}})$ represents the log odds of having high income. $\hat{p}$ is the probability of obtaining high income, which is calculated as the propensity score. $\beta_0$ represents the intercept parameter, which shows the log odds of having income greater than $\$150,000$ in a year when the age group is 20 or less; gender is female; education is 3rd Grade or less; state is AK(Alaska), and race ethnicity is white. For other $\beta$s, $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, $\beta_{3}$, $\beta_{4}$, and $\beta_{5,j}$, they all represent the corresponding slope parameters. Each of them shows the change in log odds of obtaining high income when the x corresponding to $\beta$ changes by 1 in dummy variable coding. Positive coefficients indicate the predictors have positive impacts on whether a voter has high income, for example, a positive $beta_1$ indicate the older the voter is, the higher the income, and vice versa. Also, the larger the absolute value is, the heavier the predictor can impact the income. 

After using logistic model to fit the data, we get the following equation:
$$
log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}) = -33.5482 - 0.0115x_{age,j}+0.5908x_{genderMale} + \beta_{3,j}  x_{education,j}+ \beta_{4,j} x_{state,j} + \beta_{5,j}  x_{race\_ethnicity,j}
$$

In which $\beta_{3,j}$, $\beta_{4,j}$ and $\beta_{5,j}$ are coefficients for corresponding $jth$ variable. 

In the next step, we start to match respondents with similar propensity score. Propensity score matching process entails forming matched sets of treated and untreated subjects who share a similar value of the propensity score (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983a, 1985). Once a matched sample has been formed, the treatment effect can be estimated by directly comparing outcomes between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample. 

To begin propensity score matching process in our data set, we would match the two voters that have similar propensity score while one is treated and others are not. In particular, this finds the closest respondents who have the similar gender, age, education, state and race that does not has high income, to each one that has high income. Then we reduce the data set to those that are matched so that there is a balance between treatment and comparison group on observable traits. One advantage of using propensity score matching is it balances the distribution of groups that are treated and untreated, which makes observed baseline covariates be similar(Austin, 2011). We had 389 treated, so we expect a dataset of 778 observations.

Part of reduced matched pairs are shown in Table 4 below:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# We will now add our forecast to our dataset.
filtered_data_survey <- 
  augment(propensity_score, 
          data = filtered_data_survey,
          type.predict = "response") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-.resid, -.std.resid, -.hat, -.sigma, -.cooksd) 

# Now we use our forecast to create matches. 
filtered_data_survey <- 
  filtered_data_survey %>% 
  arrange(.fitted, income_high)

# Here we're going to use a matching function 
# from the arm package. This finds which is the 
# closest of the ones that were not treated, to 
# each one that was treated.
filtered_data_survey$treated <- 
  if_else(filtered_data_survey$income_high == 0, 0, 1)

filtered_data_survey$treated  <- 
  as.integer(filtered_data_survey$treated )

matches <- arm::matching(z = filtered_data_survey$treated , 
                         score = filtered_data_survey$.fitted)

filtered_data_survey <- cbind(filtered_data_survey, matches)


# Now we reduce the dataset to just those that 
# are matched. We had 389 treated, so we expect 
# a dataset of 778 observations.
filtered_data_survey_matched <- 
  filtered_data_survey %>% 
  filter(match.ind != 0) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-match.ind, -pairs, -treated)

table <- head(filtered_data_survey_matched)
table1 <- table[1:7]
table2 <- table[6:11]
kable(table1, caption='The Information of Part of Matched Pairs')
kable(table2)
```

Finally, we perform a logistic regression to predict whether or not the indicidual will vote for Joe Biden using the following formula:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Examining the 'effect' of being treated on average
# spend in the 'usual' way.
#relevel: logistic to predict "voting for Biden"
filtered_data_survey_matched$vote_2020 <- relevel(filtered_data_survey_matched$vote_2020, ref = "Donald Trump")  

propensity_score_regression <- glm(vote_2020 ~ age + gender + education + state+race_ethnicity+income_high, 
     family = binomial,
     data = filtered_data_survey_matched)
```

$$
log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}) = \beta_{0} +\beta_{1}  x_{age,j}+\beta_{2}  x_{gender}+ \beta_{3}  x_{education,j}  + \beta_{4} x_{state,j} + \beta_{5}  x_{race\_ethnicity,j} +\beta_{6}  x_{income\_high,j}
$$

$log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}})$ represents the log odds of the voting for Joe Biden. $\hat{p}$ is the probability of voting for Joe Biden. $\beta_0$ represents the intercept parameter, which shows the log odds of voting for Joe Biden when the age group is 20 or less; gender is female; education is 3rd Grade or less; state is AK(Alaska), race-ethnicity is white and income is low(less than $\$150,000$). For other $\beta$s, $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, $\beta_{3}$, $\beta_{4}$, $\beta_{5}$ and $\beta_{6}$ they all represent the corresponding slope parameters. Each of them shows the change in log odds of voting for Joe Biden when the x corresponding to $\beta$ changes by 1 in dummy variable coding. 

After using logistic model to fit the data, we get the following equation:
$$
log(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}) = 0.5377 + 0.0105x_{age,j}-0.9181507x_{genderMale} + \beta_{3,j}  x_{education,j}+ \beta_{4,j} x_{state,j} + \beta_{5,j}  x_{race\_ethnicity,j} +0.4992 x_{income\_high,j}
$$
In which $\beta_{3,j}$, $\beta_{4,j}$ and $\beta_{5,j}$ are coefficients for corresponding $jth$ variable. 

# Results

The following table represent the result of propensity score regression. 
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
kable(tidy(propensity_score_regression), caption='The Result of Logistic Regression Model')
```

The propensity score analysis showed that the people who have high income are more likely to vote for Joe Biden. It appears that if a voter earns more than $\$150,000$, there is $37.77\%$ more possible to vote for Joe Biden. Using logistic regression model along with propensity score matching technique, this report is also able to calculate the p-value of income to indicate the impact of income on voting preference. Since the p-value of $income\_high1$ is 0.0019 which less than 0.05, it is statistically significant. So we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that income significantly affects the result of election. 

# Disscussion
## Summary
Observational study not only needs to be accurate but also relevant, time-efficient and cost-efficient. In this report, I have introduced the Nationscape data set containing information of respondents related to 2020 American president election. To evaluate the effect of whether or not a respondent earns high income in a year on the result of election, we perform logistic regression model to calculate propensity score and match closest respondents in pairs between treated and untreated. In this progress, I introduce the concept of the propensity score and described how to use propensity score matching to design and analyze the observational study. 

First, the propensity score is a balancing score: the distribution of observed baseline covariates is similar between treated and untreated subjects based on the propensity score. We use whether or not a respondent has high income as response variable and all other variables, excluding $voting\_intention$, as explanatory variables to perform a logistic regression model using a binomial family. Whereas, the odds ratio of probability of containing high income is calculated when logistic regression model is used. The probability of containing high income is calculated as propensity score. 

Second, propensity score matching method allows one to estimate treatment effects in metrics. Methods for assessing the specification of the propensity score model are based on finding the similar propensity score between treated and untreated subjects. After getting matched pairs, we reduce the data set to just those that are matched so that there is a balance between treatment and comparison group on observable traits. 

Finally, we perform a logistic regression model again on reduced data set to predict respondents' voting intention, which is the response variable, using other variables as explanatory variables. With propensity score methods, one can more easily assess whether observed confounding has been adequately eliminated, whereas this is more difficult to assess when regression-based approaches are used. 

## Conclusions

After getting the p-value of obtaining high income from logistic regression model, we will conclude whether or not the high income will affect voting intention. If p-value is less than 0.05, then the high income is statistically significant. In this case, the p-value is 0.0019212, so the high income will significantly influence respondents' voting preference. The propensity score analysis showed that the people who have high income are $37.77\%$ more likely to vote for Joe Biden. 

## Weakness & Next Steps

Generally, there are three weaknesses in our model. First of all, the data set we used to build model was generated on 25th June, 2020 which was not the latest data before the election and it is not difficult to predict that there could be a portion of people not actually voted for the exact same candidate as they mentioned when taking the survey. The nearer the election is, the fiercer the competition would be, and at the same time, situations could have changed drastically. Moreover, the size of Nationscape data is not big enough. Various NAs exist in the data set and we dropped some observations to avoid them, that's why our model is not close to perfect. Furthermore, our computing power is limited, so we cannot build more complex models. 

Our model will be more accurate if we can get the latest data before election. And we can add more data to survey data set or create a follow-up survey to reduce NAs and generate more observations. As for modeling, a few more techniques could be implemented, for example, using Bayesian model could produce better results. Last but not least, there is a caveat in the model specific part that would allow for some new technique.
